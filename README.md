# k-nearest-neighbor-customer-purchase-prediction
A simple example of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) using R

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Algorithm:** KNN (K=3)  
- **Goal:** Predict whether a new customer will make a purchase, based on age and income.  
- **Visualization:** A 2D scatterplot showing "Buy" vs "NotBuy" customers and the prediction for a new customer.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `K nearest neighbor.R` â†’ R script implementing KNN using the `class` package.  
- `KNN_plot.png` â†’ Output image of the visualization.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
In R:
```r
library(class)
# K nearest neighbor.R
